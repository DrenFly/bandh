                <p>I am an intuitive healer using life force energy to help provide balance and wellness to those I work with. This energy works with the mind, body and spirit and can produce surprising results. People often association energy healing with Reiki.  Although I work with Reiki and use some of the traditional methods of traditional Usui Reiki, for me it goes beyond Reiki or any other ‘system’ of applying healing. I am not a doctor, shaman, therapist or witch. I am just someone who feels blessed every day that I am able to tap into the universal energy which allows me to work with it.</p>

                <p>I believe each one of us has the ability to tap into this energy. If you nurture this gift it can become a skill. I use this skill to work with an individual to co-create an energy clearing, balancing and healing that is right for the individual. During the process I am intuitively guided to work on certain parts of the body and will often see energy blockages and get insights into the deeper emotional issues causing these blockages.</p>
                    
                <p>The person receiving this energy, is still fully in control.  I am unable to clear anything from your energy field that you do not consent to. An individual may not always be consciously aware of the energy within their field that may be causing dis-ease, however your energy body and subconscious mind knows what you need in order to feel more balanced, peaceful and healthier.  Equally I will not be shown any parts of your energy that are not yet ready to be healed. That is why we always start a session with the intention that any clearing that takes place is for the individual’s highest and best good. </p>

                <p>Receiving this energy is putting your trust in the greater universal power.  All of this energy is sent with pure love and universal wisdom.  For some this can result in a straight forward clearing of energy that is causing discomfort in a certain area, for example a sore foot.  For others this helps clear energy that is blocking us from seeing our next step forward to achieving happiness and peace, however there is still work to be done.  You don’t have to believe whole hardheartedly in this energy, you just need to be willing to be open to receiving it. </p>

                <p>Claims of healing – There is no one definitive study that will convince everyone that energy healing works.  However there are so many studies now looking at the power of belief and intention of the individual as a massive factor in their recovery and wellness.    Within this work there is no  guarantee of complete healing or wellness.  Each individual experience will be completely different and will go at the pace that the person is ready for.</p>

                <p>If you are interesting in finding out more, a good starting point is the film ‘Heal’ which is currently on Netflix.  Otherwise, please feel free to contact me and I can recommend books that you may be interested in if you want to look deeper into this. </p>

                “I believe there exists One Supreme Being – the Absolute Infinite – a Dynamic Force that governs the world and universe. It is an unseen spiritual power that vibrates and all other powers fade into insignificance beside it. So, therefore, it is Absolute! I shall call it “Reiki”. Being a universal force from the Great Divine Spirit, it belongs to all who seek and desire to learn the art of healing.”
